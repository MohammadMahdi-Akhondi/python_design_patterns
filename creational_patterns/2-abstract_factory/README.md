# Abstract Factory

Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern, which solves the problem of creating entire product families 
without specifying their concrete classes.


## Applications
- Use the Abstract Factory when your code needs to work with various families of related products, but you don’t want it to depend 
on the concrete classes of those products—they might be unknown beforehand or you simply want to allow for future extensibility.

- Consider implementing the Abstract Factory when you have a class with a set of Factory Methods that blur its primary responsibility.

## Explanation men cloth

In this example, I considered that we have two types of men's clothes in the categories of t-shirt and dress shirt, 
and each of them can be made of cotton or linen.
