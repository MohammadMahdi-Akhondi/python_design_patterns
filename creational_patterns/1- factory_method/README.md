# Factory Method

Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, 
but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.


## Applications
- Use the Factory Method when you donâ€™t know beforehand the exact types and dependencies of the objects your code should work with.

- Use the Factory Method when you want to provide users of your library or framework with a way to extend its internal components.

- Use the Factory Method when you want to save system resources by reusing existing objects instead of rebuilding them each time.

## Explanation of academy courses

In this example, we assumed that several courses are being held in an academy, 
and each class has its own information such as the duration of the course.
